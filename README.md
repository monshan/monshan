# Hi, 大家好, 안녕하세요! I'm Marika Shanahan 👩🏻‍💻

My pronouns are: __she/her/hers__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018 I packed my life in a suitcase to move to China to follow my desire for mastery of the language and dive into the expat lifestyle. As an ESL Teacher (English as a Second Language) in Beijing, I equipped my students with functional language skills in a manner that was easily accessible and with respect to their educational goals. Despite cultural barriers, I utilized my own Mandarin language skills and self-advocacy to navigate a dramatically different working culture that brought together Chinese locals and multiple primarily English-speaking nationalities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since returning to the States with these foundations and transitioning into Web Merchandising, I became just as deeply interested and committed to software development as a career path. After 8 months as a full-time student at Turing School of Software and Design, I am confident in my problem-solving with multiple technologies (such as React, JavaScript, Cypress Testing, and Node.js) in a collaborative environment and am excited to see what great teams and projects I can contribute to.
